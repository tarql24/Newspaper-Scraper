# NPR News Scraper

This app allows users to view NPR News articles, save their favorites onto another page, and comment on their favorites. Each article displayed includes a headline which is also a link to the source article and a description that includes the date of publish. There is a 'remove' button next to each article on the saved articles page, but currently it does not work. The app uses Node/Express for the server and routing, MongoDB/Mongoose for the database and models, Handlebars for the layout and views, & Cheerio/Request for scraping the data from www.npr.org

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. I will assume that you already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed locally. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

1. Install dependencies
2. In your CLI, enter **mongod**
3. In a new CLI window, go to root of directory and enter **node server.js**
4. In browser, navigate to **http://localhost:3000**

### Dependencies

You will need to npm install the following node modules:

1. express
2. express-handlebars
3. mongoose
4. body-parser
5. cheerio
6. request

Since I have included a package.json file, you do not need to install dependencies by name. Simply run the following in the root of your directory:

```
npm install
```

## Deployment

Follow these instructions to deploy your app live on Heroku

Create a heroku app in your project directory

```
heroku create <projectName>
```

Provision mLab MongoDB add-on for your project

```
heroku addons:create mongolab
```

Now your project should be successfully deployed on heroku.
