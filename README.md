### Dependencies

Here are the npm installs for the node modules:

1. express
2. express-handlebars
3. mongoose
4. body-parser
5. cheerio
6. request

Since I have included a package.json file, you do not need to install dependencies by name. Simply run the following in the root of your directory:

```
npm install
```
